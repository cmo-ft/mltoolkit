# MLToolkit

The MLToolkit is a comprehensive machine learning library for developing and deploying machine learning models for bbtautau tasks. It is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use.

## Directory Structure

- `bin`: This directory contains executable scripts for various tasks such as training models, evaluating performance, and running predictions.

- `Datasets`: This directory is where all the data files used for training and testing the machine learning models are stored. It may also contain scripts for preprocessing or augmenting the data.

- `Metrics`: This directory contains scripts for calculating and evaluating different performance metrics of the machine learning models.

- `Networks`: This directory contains the different neural network architectures that can be used in the machine learning tasks. Each file typically defines a different model.

- `Runners`: This directory contains scripts that manage the training and testing process of the models. They typically handle tasks like model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.

- `Tools`: This directory contains utility scripts that are used across the project. These may include data loaders, model savers, logging tools, etc.

## Usage

1. **Setup the environment**: Before running the toolkit, you need to set up the environment:

    ```bash
    source setup.sh
    ```

2. **Run the toolkit**: The `run_mltoolkit.py` script is the main entry point to the toolkit. It takes a configuration file as an argument, which specifies various parameters for the machine learning task, such as the dataset to use, the model to train, and the hyperparameters for training. The configuration file is in YAML format. To run the toolkit with a specific configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`), use the following command:

    ```bash
    python run_mltoolkit.py -c config.yaml
    ```

    Replace `config.yaml` with the path to your own configuration file. The `-c` flag is used to specify the configuration file.
